Project 2 involves writing an analysis of the results that you obtained in first project. You are to submit a paper that discusses the results of your analysis. Your paper should include the following items:

<ul>

 <li>A brief introduction of the sorting algorithm that you have selected and how the two versions of the algorithm compare including:

  <ul>

   <li>High-level pseudocode for the sorting algorithms o A Big-Θ analysis of the two versions of the algorithm</li>

   <li>An explanation of your approach to avoiding the problems associated with JVM warm-up</li>

   <li>A discussion of the critical operation that you chose to count with an explanation of why you selected it</li>

  </ul></li>

 <li>An analysis of the results of your study, which should include:

  <ul>

   <li>graph of critical operations for both algorithms and one for the execution times o a comparison of the performance of the two versions of the algorithm o         a comparison of the critical operation results and the actual execution time measurements</li>

   <li>a discussion of the significance of the coefficient of variance results and how it reflects the data sensitivity of your algorithm</li>

   <li>how your results compare to your Big-Θ analysis</li>

  </ul></li>

 <li>A conclusion that summarizes the important observations of your study</li>

</ul>

If for any reason, it was necessary to revise the program you submitted in project 1, the revised source code should also be included along with the paper.
